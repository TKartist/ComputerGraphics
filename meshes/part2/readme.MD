Exercise 1: main.cpp
Exercise 2: part2Large.cpp (for rendering of larger dataset), part2.cpp (for small dataset)

There isn't any difference between part2Large.cpp and part2.cpp except the obj file they are
reading from.

I separated the 2 because it was easier than passing the filename or a flag as a parameter for
the bash script.

analysis.py file is for finding important data points and generating the graph.
